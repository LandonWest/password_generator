# Ruby Password Generator
This is a simple random string generator that shuffles upper and lowercase english alphabet characters, numbers 0-9, and a few common symbols.

## Getting started

include the module and call Password.gen in your code. The default and recommended length is 16, but you can pass in any number to get a different length.

I've found [HowSecureIsMyPassword](https://howsecureismypassword.net/) is a cool website to play around with different lengths and combinations and see passwords' estimated strength.
